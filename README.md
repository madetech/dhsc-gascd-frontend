## About This Project

This is the Repo/Code for the DHSC Data Access Platform Frontend. This application primarily utilises the following technologies:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [GovUk React](https://govuk-react.github.io/govuk-react/?path=/docs/welcome--docs)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb) - [Web](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/app-service/web), [Function App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-csharp) and [Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/pipelines)

With this project we aim to:

- To improve both quality and efficiency of data and insight analysis at a local, regional and national level
- To enable better decision making across all stakeholders to improve the delivery of high-quality care across the sector
- To reduce siloed data sharing and alleviate cost and effort inefficiencies
- To enhance data and insights sharing within the adult social care sector using NHS as a ‘baseline’

## Setup

### Requirements

This project requires the following pre-requisites:

1. [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
3. [Make](https://makefiletutorial.com/)

#### Installing project dependencies

1. Clone the repo to your chosen directory
2. Navigate to the App directory `cd app`
3. Install dependencies `npm i`

#### Setting up husky pre-commit hooks

1. Navigate to the root of the project
2. Run the command 'make setup-husky' 
3. Linting and Prettier should now run on any staged changes during pre-commit


## Usage

### Running the application

To run the application you must ensure you've followed the setup steps

- To run the app via Docker in the project root directory run: `make docker-up`
- To run the app via Node:
  - Navigate to app directory: `cd app`
  - spin up the application: `npm start`
  - To run tests (_currently there is low test coverage_) `npm test`

## Continuous Integration, Development and Deployment

### CI/CD

This project uses Azure DevOps Pipelines for continuous integration and deployment. There are currently two environments Dev and Production which we continuously integrate with. The CI/CD Pipeline has the following stages:

- Test: This step runs the tests
- Build and Push: This steps builds a docker image and pushes to container registry
- Deploy: This step deploys the application to Azure Web App
